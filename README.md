# AI-Oriented Programming (AIOP)

This repository contains a proposal, documentation, and prototype implementation for a new programming paradigm called AI-Oriented Programming (AIOP).

## What is AI-Oriented Programming?

AI-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm that treats AI components (models, training pipelines, inference engines) as first-class citizens in software development. It emphasizes learning-based problem solving, probabilistic execution, natural language integration, and continuous adaptation.

## Repository Structure

- `/docs`: Contains the manifesto and technical specifications
- `/examples`: Contains example code and usage patterns
- `/prototype`: Contains a working prototype implementation in TypeScript

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+)
- npm or yarn

### Setup

```bash
cd prototype
npm install
npm run build
```

### Running the Prototype

```bash
cd prototype
npm start
```

This will run the demo that shows AI-oriented programming concepts in action.

## Core Concepts

1. **Learning Blocks**: Code constructs that learn from examples rather than being explicitly programmed
2. **Confidence-Based Execution**: Decision making based on confidence levels of AI results
3. **Adaptive Behavior**: Systems that evolve during runtime based on feedback and new data
4. **Natural Language Integration**: Programming interfaces that support natural language directives
5. **AI-Enhanced Testing**: Testing frameworks that handle probabilistic outputs and fairness concerns

## Future Directions

- Development of a specialized AIOP language
- Creation of IDE plugins supporting AIOP development
- Building libraries of AI-oriented design patterns
- Development of testing frameworks for AI components

## Contributing

This is a research project, and we welcome contributions in the form of:

- Additional examples and patterns
- Enhancements to the prototype
- Documentation improvements
- Use case proposals
